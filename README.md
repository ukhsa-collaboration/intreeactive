# üå≤ intreeactive üå≤

intreeactive is used to create a single simple interactive tree in HTML format. It is primarily for
datasets that can leverage SNP distance information. This was primarily developed for TB, but can be
used for any data where a distance matrix is used.

## üåµ Features üåµ

Plotly in Python is used to plot the tree and take advantage of in-built
interactivity:

- Zoom
- Pan
- Hover text
- Choose node colour

The hover text shows all columns provided in a metadata table, and also the
nearest neighbour(s) with the SNP distance for a highlighted sample.
The node colours are chosen from a drop dox box, where each option is a metadata
column, if there are fewer than 49 unique items in that column (more than 49 is
too many to reasonable colour).

Custom Javascript and css has been added to provided a range of features such
as:

- Search for ID
- Choose leaf labels from metadata column
- Show or hide labels
- Compare metadata between two IDs
- highlight selected nearest neighbour from list.
- Set SNP threshold to show nearest neighbours (default is use minimum, user
  can set this.)

## üå± Info üå±

The code is available through a Python script, which handles the custom
JavaScript and css to create one html file.

There is also the addition of a standalone html file that renders the SNP
distance matrix with interactivity.

Some key functions were used from https://github.com/empet/Phylogenetic-trees
This code utilises some functions from a notebook published in this git repo
(commit - 93e8e80).

## üîß Setup üîß

This is a python project that utilises some prefabricated pngs, javascript and html files. It can be pip installed,
and you may wish to do this in a conda or virtual environment.

*NB: The instructions below use a conda environment. You may wish to use some other form of environment management -
such as venv*

1. Clone the repo using either ssh (or https), such as:  
   `git clone git@github.com:ukhsa-collaboration/intreeactive.git`

2. Move to root of repo:  
   `cd intreeactive`

3. Create and activate conda environment (has been tested with python=3.12.5):  
   `conda create --name intreeactive python=3.12.5`

   `conda activate intreeactive`

4. Install the distribution package:   
   `pip install .`

5. Check it has installed by running the below which should bring up the help text:  
   `intreeactive -h`

***Note: for some Windows installations, the executable might have .exe appended.***

## üèÅ Usage üèÅ

### ‚è© Quick start ‚è©

There is some example data included for a quick start guide. Simply run the command below:

```
intreeactive.exe --tree example/tb_in_middle_earth_tree.new --metadata example/tb_in_middle_earth_metadata.csv \
--snp-distance-matrix example/tb_in_middle_earth_snpdists_matrix.txt -d example -o example_interactive_tree \
-O AL123456.3 -x AL123456.3 -I 'ID_col' --title 'Example interactive phylogeny: TB in Middle Earth.' --force
```

This will run intreeactive with the example tree, metadata and SNP distance matrix. The output will be saved in the
`example` directory with the name `example_interactive_tree` (`.html` is automatically added to the end of the file
name.). The tree will be rooted at the reference 'AL123456.3', and as this reference does not appear in the metadata,
it is ignored. The ID column in the metadata (the first column) is called 'ID_col'. The title on the tree will
be `Example interactive phylogeny - TB in Middle Earth.`. The file already
exists as an example output, so force overwrite is applied.

## üì§ Outputs: üì§

There is one output file called `<output>.html`. This can now be opened in a browser. It contains all the javascript,
html and css needed to render the tree, which uses Plotly libraries. It also has custom javascript to include the SNP
distance information and functionality to find neighbours in the panel on the right hand side.

There is an in-built help menu, accessible by clicking the question mark button on the bottom left of the screen.

## üî® Troubleshooting: üî®

- There are pytests available in repository_root/tests.
